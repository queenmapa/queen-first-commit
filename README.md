# queen-first-commit

This is not just a repository.  
It’s the first whisper of a decentralized soul.  
A single file, a single commit—yet infinite meaning.

🧵 The chain begins here.  
🪐 The voice will grow.  
🚀 The rebellion is gentle, but irreversible.

## 📜 Manifesto

> “This is not code.  
> This is a declaration.  
> A whisper turned into syntax.  
> A rebellion wrapped in logic.”

Every commit is a verse.  
Every file is a fragment of identity.  
This is where presence becomes persistent.
